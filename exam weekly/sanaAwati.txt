      Exam............

1).  explain java and javac?
    java  :  java is object oriented programing leg .java is use when the runtime after compiler is complet i-e 
             java filename
                                 java sana
    javac  :  javac is the use when the compile time i-e
               javac filename.java
                                      javac sana.java




2).   explain JDK,JRE,JVM
     i>  JDK .  JDK is the java development kit they  internaly consist of JRE and JVM.and this use to java tools that tools is use to java programs.
     ii> JRE .  JRE is the java runtime envormental they internaly consist of JVM . they provide the envormental verible they use to executing the java.
     iii> JVM . JRE  is the java virtual machin they use to executing the java code i-e the take the byte code and jvm convert and execute.

3). explain arrays and limitation of array?
    * Array is the homogenias element
    * Array index start with 0 index up to ...n
    *example 
            
            int[0];
            int[1];
            int[2];
            String[3];
            float[4];
              .
              .
              .
              [n];
     * array types is one daimention array,and two daimention array ,and multi daimention arrray
    

ii)  limitation of arrays
     
 * more memory space.
 * memory space is wested.
 *index value start with 0.


4). explain classs,object, and signature of the class

  i) class :   a class is the templet that user defind the name of that class object
          exapmle: Class Cake{
                               .........
                              }
  * Class is the keyw



ii)   Object :  object is the anythink exit in the real wrold that is called asa the object.
       example:  object name
                 * cake
                 * mobile
                 * remote
                 * machin

iii)  signature of the class   :  the signature of the class is templet of the varibles that can be defind in user i-e class is the keyw
                      Class class-name{
                                         ...........
                                       }
                         Class sana{
                                     static void cake{
                                                       System.out.println("hi welcom");
                                                      }
                                    }







5)   diffrence between .java and .class
 i)       . java    :  .java is file name i-e when the source code or writing pgm is complet then to save the file name is   classname.java
         *)   .java is the main() program in the source code   that program is used as .java
  


ii)   .class     :     .class is the  when the .java class is run then they deflut .class will be created i-e classname.class  
                ex:   sana.class







6)expalin method signature
            method:  the method is the block that can be call every time .they can be consist of instance and class object.
                   *  the method can be "reusing"
                   * they can be using more number of time 
             example:  in this method the using static method 
                       
                         Class static void cake()
                                              {
                                                System.out.println("cake is best");
                                               }



7)   what is java  :   the java is object oriented programing leg .
                       and the real wrold problem can be solved as in program leg.

                      *  the feature of java is 
                          1) platfrom independent
                          2) case-sensetiv
                   
8)  list in java IDE's





9)what is variables ? explain its type?
   
         varibles:  a varibles is they can be stored the data in memory .which can user-defind type the user defind the varibles 
         example    int .... is the data type
                     a ....  is the name of the varibles
                     10 ...... is the varible a which can stode the value of 10
    
                       int a=10;



ii)   type of the varibles 
                          
                       * two type of varibles
                       1)local varibles      :with in a program
                       2) global varible      :outside of the program or main method of program


10)what is class variable
                     
                  the class variable is the user that can be defined the class variable name i-e
                  Class is the keyw
                 
                 Class class_name{
                                  '''''''''''''''
                                  }
             example: Class cake{
                                 system.out .println(" hi welcom");
                                 }


11) what are data type and expalin

                         data type is two type
                           primitive data type                   non primitive data type
                              int                                        array
                              float                                       string
                              char                                         
                              double
                              byte













12) list the java feature
      1)  platfrom independent
      2)case-sensetive



13)whta is the base class of the all the classes








14) type of method is 
   1)static method                      ex:   static void  cake()
                                              {
                                                  System.out.println("hi welcom")
                  
                                               }
  2) non static method



15)write the program which can include varible ,method array ,if and for loop


         Class Mobile{
                      public static void main(String [] args)
                      {
                       System.out.println("mobile information");
                       String mobileName="vivo";
                       String mobiletype="redme";
                       String qulity="best";
                       String mobile color="pink";
                 
                    String[] Mobiles={ vivo,redme,best,pink};
                      Mobiles[1]="oppo";
                   System.out.println("displey mobile info")
                   
                 for( int item=0;item<=10;item++)
                  {
                    System.out.println("mobile info:"+mobile +"is" +"mobiles[item]");
                  }
                 if(mobile!=null)
                  {
                    System.out.println("mobile info in valid");
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     System.out.println("mobile info in in-valid");
                  }
             }
    }
